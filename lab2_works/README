Lab 2 Write-Up
Mindy Huang and Nicholas Freybler

MIPS_CPU
- Found countless "dangling" wires such as the line of "mem_read_XX". Though they were instantiated, they were
  not being used to regulate LW and LB. This was promptly changed.

INSTR_FETCH
- Added functionality and inputs/outputs for:
	- J, JR, BEQ, BNE, BLEZ, BLTZ, BGEZ
		- all these functions required simple ternary (multiplexor) operations based on
		  control signals produced in "decode.v"

DECODE
- "Dangling wires"
	- jr_pc for JR functionality
- Needed to change sign extend so not all immediates are sign extended
- Added functionality for:
	- MUL
		- should have used SPECIAL2 rather than SPECIAL1
	- SRA, SRAV
	- BEQ, BNE, BGEZ, BLEZ, BLTZ
		- jump_branch boolean signal is regulated by the existence of these opcodes
		  as well as a quick comparison with rs_data
    - MOVN, MOVZ
- xori, ori, andi shouldn't be sign extended
	- change ori tests to reflect this 
	- andi, addiu already have tests for sign extension
- overflow checking for add and sub are already handled

ALU
- Added functionality for: 
	- MUL
	- SRA, SRAV
- Added isShiftImm and isShift

MEMORY
- Fixed "dangling wires" mentioned in "mips_cpu.v".
- Also, through manipulation in other modules, added/fixed functionality for:
	- SB, LW, LB

FORWARDING, STALLS & HAZARD MAINTENANCE
in "decode.v"
- forward_rs_mem, forward_rs_ex, forward_rt_mem, forward_rt_ex all tell whether a register is available at a certain stage
- rs_mem_dependency and rt_mem_dependency tell whether there is a dependency that can make use of the availablility
  from above
- using the two above pieces of information, we can use a mux to select whether the current value of rs/rt is sufficient
  or if we will be using a forwarded signal.  This results in complete forwarding.

- Stalls were a little trickier. There is the obvious one-cycle stall required to happen in the event that we are waiting
  on a memory read.
- There is also a second, less-obvious necessary stall which occurs when there are two or more RAW hazards in a row, all
  of which use the same register.

in "mips_cpu.v"
- In the event of a stall, it was necessary to implement a delay for the PC, which, once again, was done with the simple
  addition of a mux at the pc input to if_id pc register. This resulted in the instructions and PC sync'ing up.

TESTING
- Created tests for ADDI, NOR, OR, XORI, SLT, SLTU, SLLV, SB, MOVN, MOVN
- Testing not necessary for SW, since SW is used in almost every test, sometimes in succeeding order
  with the same registers.
- Modified/fixed tests for SLTIU, SLTI, MOVN
- Before forward/stall functionality, included two NOPs between every RAW hazard in virtually every test
- After complete forward/stall functionality, removed all NOPs other than those that needed to follow
  branches/jumps
