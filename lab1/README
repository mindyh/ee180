Optimizations:
--

Makefile: 
	- added an -Ofast optimization flag. This helped a lot - the compiler optimized a lot of instructions for us elsewhere in the code.
	- removed the -fno-tree-vectorize flag. 

grayScale():
	- removed intermediary variable 'color'

sobelCalc():
	- moved calculations for y and total in to the for-loop for the x calculation. This saves having to loop through the same image 3 times.
	- removed intermediary variables: instead of creating temporary variables to name and hold calculations for x and y like any sane software engineer, we added and assigned x and y to total in one step. Not sure if this actually achieved anything, as this micro-optimization is something the compiler should handle.
