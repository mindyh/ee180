TODO: Write your lab report here. See the handout for more information.



Decode
- Needed to change sign extend so not all immediates are sign extended
- Added functionality for SRA, SRAV, MUL
	- should have used SPECIAL2 rather than SPECIAL1
- xori, ori, andi shouldn't be sign extended
	- change ori tests to reflect this 
	- andi, addiu already have tests for sign extension
- overflow checking for add and sub are already handled

ALU
- Added functionality for SRA, SRAV, MUL
- Added isShiftImm and isShift

TESTING
- Created tests for ADDI, NOR, OR, XORI, SLT, SLTU, SLLV, SB, MOVN, MOVN
- Testing not necessary for SW, since SW is used in almost every test
- Modified/fixed tests for SLTIU, SLTI
- Before forward/stall functionality, included two NOPs between every RAW hazard in virtually every test
