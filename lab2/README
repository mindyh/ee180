TODO: Write your lab report here. See the handout for more information.




- Needed to change sign extend so not all immediates are sign extended (decode.v)

- xori, ori, andi shouldn't be sign extended
- change ori tests to reflect this 
- andi, addiu already have tests for sign extension
- needed to add SRA and SRAV to decode, alu, and isShiftImm and isShift
- overflow checking for add and sub are already handled
- need to add mul to decode and alu. uses Special2 instead of Special, for some reason
- need to create tests and such for addi, nor, or, xori, slt, sltu, sllv
- sltiu and slti have incorrect tests
